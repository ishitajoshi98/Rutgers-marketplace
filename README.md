# Rutgers Marketplace

Students often face difficulties buying and selling items such as furniture, bikes and textbooks when moving in or out of on-campus/off-campus housing. Current solutions (e.g., Facebook groups, Whatsapp groups, word-of-mouth) are unorganized and filled with scammers. This results in wasted time, unfair pricing and items left unsold.
This app offers a simple student-to-student marketplace for Rutgers to solve this problem

## ✨ Overview

Rutgers Marketplace is a full-stack web app designed to make student-to-student buying and selling safe, simple and scam-free.

Students can:
- Post listings with images, campus info, and pickup locations
- Browse items by category, campus, or price
- Place bids or express interest
- Manage their own listings, bids, and purchases
- Communicate directly to complete the sale

> **Note:** This app does not currently handle payments. The transaction is completed independently by the buyer and seller. This keeps the app lightweight and focused, though payment features can be added in future versions.



## 💡 Why It Exists

Most students currently use Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats or word-of-mouth to buy or sell items around campus. These methods are messy and often unreliable. Scams, ghosted messages, and lowball offers are common.

**Rutgers Marketplace** was built to solve that by offering a trusted, campus-specific solution that works the way students actually need it to. No spam. No strangers. Just students helping students.
